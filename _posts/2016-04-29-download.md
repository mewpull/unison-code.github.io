#### Unison

Unison's source code is available at <https://github.com/unison-code/unison>
under the [BSD3](https://github.com/unison-code/unison/blob/master/LICENSE.md)
license.

To try it out, just clone the Unison repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/unison-code/unison.git
```

and follow the instructions in the
[README.md](https://github.com/unison-code/unison/blob/master/README.md) file.

#### Unison Driver for LLVM

Unison can be run as a standalone tool but is only really useful as a complement
to a full-fledged compiler such as [LLVM](http://llvm.org/). A LLVM fork
including a Unison driver is available at
<https://github.com/unison-code/llvm>. The Unison driver is built on top of
LLVM's [`llc`](http://llvm.org/docs/CommandGuide/llc.html) code generator and
released under the same
[BSD3](https://github.com/unison-code/llvm/blob/master-unison/LICENSE.md)
license.

To try it out, just clone the LLVM fork:

```
git clone https://github.com/unison-code/llvm.git
```

and follow the instructions in the
[README.md](https://github.com/unison-code/llvm/blob/master-unison/README.md)
file from any of the branches with a `-unison` suffix.
